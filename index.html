          <h2>What is React Native ?</h2>
          <p>It is a framework that allows you to create applications for different platforms using the same codebase.
          </p>
          <p> With React Native, companies can only create code once and use it to power their iOS and Android apps.</p>
          <p>React Native was built on top of React, a JavaScript library that was already extremely popular when the
            mobile platform was released.</p>

        <h3> History </h3>
        <p>In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg admitted that “the biggest mistake we made as a company was that we bet too much on
          HTML.
          in 2013, Facebook developer Jordan Walk made a discovery,when he found a method to create UI elements for iOS
          apps using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
          This caused a sensation and a special hackathon was organized to explore how much mobile development can be
          done using traditional JavaScript web-solutions.

        <h2> React vs React Native </h2>
        <p>Both React and React Native use a mix of JavaScript and a special markup language called JSX.</p>
        <p>
          However, the syntax used to render elements in JSX components is different between React and React Native.
          React JSX renders HTML-like components such as
          &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;p&gt; , etc. Meanwhile, react-native renders the application's native view components such as
          &lt;View&gt; ,
          &lt;Text&gt; , &lt;Image&gt;,
          &lt;ScrollView&gt;

        <h2>How does react native work</h2>
        <p>React Native uses what is called a “bridge”. JavaScript stream and native streams are written in completely
          different languages, but with the bridging feature system makes bidirectional communication possible.</p>

        <h2>Cross-platform development</h2>
        <p>Cross-platform development is the practice of creating software that is compatible with more than one type of
          hardware platform.</p>
        <p>Logical components will be the same for android and iOS </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"> Large audience </li>
          <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"> Platform сonsistency </li>

        <h2>Why React Native is unique?</h2>
        <p>
          The difference between React Native and other cross-platform development solutions (such as Flutter, Cordova
          and
          PhoneGap) is that React Native doesn't render a WebView in code. It runs on real, native views and
          components. This is one of the reasons for React Native's impressive success.
